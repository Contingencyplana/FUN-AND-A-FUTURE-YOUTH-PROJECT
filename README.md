# FUN AND A FUTURE YOUTH PROJECT GUIDELINES

## Manifesto

With all due respect, it is *NOT* hard!
Many Millennials — and certainly EVEN MORE Generation Zs — realize that there are WAY *WAY* Better Ways of going about Transformative Technology, Language Engineering, kickstarting companies and innovation than those propounded by their elders and their elders are generally WAY *WAY* too bloodyminded and pigheaded to admit that Exceedingly Simple FACT!!

Ergo that the simplest, easiest, quickest, most natural, most intrinsically innate, most imaginative, most insightful, most in-depth, most inclusive, most sound and sensible, most meaningful, most Creative, most foolproof, most forward thinking, most futuristic, most fun Fun *FUN*, most visionary, most kind, caring and Loving and generally BEST way; for almost anything (AI inclusive) or anyone to learn, teach, coach, master and utilize almost anything is through interactive *PLAY*!

By which I mean that the future of:

- eLearning (electronic learning or learning via the internet),
- eTeaching (electronic teaching),
- eCoaching (electronic coaching),
- eMastering (electronic mastering) and
- eUtilizing (electronic utilizing);

is multiplayer video games!

WHY is it *INDEED SO*?
Because:

envisioning:

- **1.** eLearning,
- **2.** eTeaching,
- **3.** eCoaching,
- **4.** eMastering and
- **5.** eUtilizing;

via multiplayer video games;

developing:

- **6.** eLearning,
- **7.** eTeaching,
- **8.** eCoaching,
- **9.** eMastering and
- **10.** eUtilizing;

via multiplayer video games;

coding:

- **11.** eLearning,
- **12.** eTeaching,
- **13.** eCoaching,
- **14.** eMastering and
- **15.** eUtilizing;

via multiplayer video games and

- **16.** Miscellaneous Core Creativity;

are likely the *ONLY* SIXTEEN *THINGS* standing between us and 90% to 99% worldwide unemployment by 2050, largely courtesy of COVID-19, the *waves of plagues* on the way and corporate greed driven, AI driven automation!
Something many Millennials and even more Generation Zs realize at least subconsciously, as opposed to exceedingly few of their elders!

The Solution?
To 90% to 99% worldwide unemployment by 2050, Climate Change and Earth's myriad myriad:

- *EVER* increasing,
- *EVER* MORE severe,
- *EVER* MORE complex,
- *EVER* MORE multifocal and
- *EVER* MORE mass and mainstream media; toned-down, played-down, covered-up and swept-under-the-carpet;

woes more generally?

Why FUN and a Future Youth Project or a project for:

- children,
- teens and
- youth generally;

and involving both:

- *TONS* of FUN and
- an incredibly broad range of decades-ahead-of-their-time career options in the aforementioned sixteen areas of Core Creativity.

Ergo a FUN and a Future Youth Project's Funnel of Funnels or BOTH:

The following 21 (3 existing, 2 parallel and 16 new) language generations:

- **1.** machine code,
- **2.** assembly code,
- **3.** mid-level languages (C, C+, C#, etc.),
- **4.** Fun and a Future DSL (Domain Specific Language) (age 16 and up),
- **5.** Lingual Labmaker (eventually a LL1 subset through LL2 subset) its LL1 – Storybook and SB2 – LL2 subsets have RAFBIN (Read-A-Functionality and BInary Navigation) via clicking either a left or right page (age 4 and up),
- **6.** TaleTome (supremely simple) RAFBIN (age 2 and up),
- **7.** StoryBook (extremely simple) RAFBIN (age 3 and up),
- **8.** GrabAndDrag (read-aloud-functionality) (age 5 and up),
- **9.** SideScroll (age 6 and up),
- **10.** Semi3D (age 7 and up),
- **11.** Panoramic (age 8 and up),
- **12.** TopDownView (age 9 and up),
- **13.** TIIR (Turning Ideas Into Reality *one-stop-shop* startup and innovation hub) (age 10 and up),
- **14.** TDV2 (TopDownView2) (age 9 and up),
- **15.** P2 (age 8 and up),
- **16.** S3D2 (age 7 and up),
- **17.** SS2 (age 6 and up),
- **18.** GAD2 (read-aloud functionality) (age 5 and up),
- **19.** SB2 (extremely simple) RAFBIN (age 3 and up),
- **20.** TT2 (supremely simple) RAFBIN (age 2 and up) and
- **21.** LL2 (incredibly simple) RAFBIN (age 1 and up) (Baby Smash is currently the world's simplest video game).

From Lingual Labmaker onward in the form of 18 (storyquest libraried, devtoolscaped, FUN and a Future style) multiplayer video game libraries.
To be largely:

- planned,
- designed,
- built,
- learnt,
- mastered and
- utilized;

by:

- AIs (grunts / privates),
- toddlers (largely trail-blazers / lances),
- children (largely storyquestors / senior noncoms) and
- teens (largely questmasters / officers),

and largely:

- overseen by layman adults (largely questlibrarians / generals) and
- orchestrated by language Engineers (largely questlords / field marshals).

Or thus by and for a ***millions strong army*** set which ***MEANINGFUL***:

- Grand Adventure and
- Mighty Quest.

And the following seven overlapping main phases:

- **1.** the children and teens planning, designing, learning how to build and building the world's first Lingual Labmaker (a Language Forgemaker inclusive) in the form of a multiplayer video game; or 4GL through 21GL's initial facet,
- **2.** the children and teens utilizing Lingual Labmaker to plan, design, learn how to build and build; 18 (2 parallel and 16 new) Lingual Lab generations and hence 18 (2 parallel and 16 new) Language Machine Shop generations, as each Lingual Lab will have a Language Machine Shop; or 4GL through 21GL's second facet,
- **3.** the children and teens utilizing the 18 Lingual Lab generations to plan, design, learn how to build and build; both 18 (2 parallel and 16 new) Lingual Labbench generations and 18 (2 parallel and 16 new) Language Workbench generations; or 4GL through 21GL's third facet,
- **4.** the children and teens utilizing the 18 computer Lingual Labbench generations and 18 Language Workbench generations; to plan, design, learn how to build and build; 18 (2 parallel and 16 new) computer language generations; or 4GL to 21GL's forth facet,
- **5.** the children and teens utilizing the 18 computer language generations to plan, design, learn how to build and build; Core Creativity Infrastructure more generally – further language generations inclusive,
- **6.** the children and teens utilizing Core Creativity Infrastructure to build Multitudifarious (Multitudinously Varied) Synergy generally and
- **7.** the children and teens utilizing Multitudifarious Synergy to build a Panmovement's Panrevolution's Panadvance's Panreform's Panoverhaul's Geniune Broad-Spectrum Solution for Earth generally.

That is the *general idea* will be for players — post the *creation of the initial 25% of Lingual Labmaker's LL1 subset* — to build the *rest of LL1 subset* over the course of five years or so and then build:

- **1.** a Lingual Labmaker subset (segment),
- **2.** a lingual lab per Lingual Labmaker subset and
- **3.** a computer language per lingual lab;

every three years or so.
With the initial quarter of LL1 subset's (LL1 arch game level's) screenshot comprised, thoughtrain comprised, game level comprised, AI player (cybergod – each AI player will thus appear) comprised, (AI and human player played in) mindscape comprised, Hive AI (cyberpantheon of gods) to thus be the genesis of Lingual Labmaker and Lingual Labmaker to thus be the genesis (or initial storybook storyquest MMO video game) of FUN and a Future Youth Project.

## Vision and Mission

I currently *VERY* STRONGLY *FEEL* that that the following thirty KEY fields and/or ecosystems and/or political systems and/or advances are incredibly intricately, kaleidoscopically eclectically, synergistically intermeshed:

- **1.** Holographic computing (micro-universe to umpteenth-micro-universe holographic computing inclusive – atoms are micro-universes aka micro-packets-of-time-and-space or thus infinitely deep fractals).
- **2.** A ***going to play as opposed to mere work or school concept*** (gamification applications — or applications that convert non-gaming applications into multiplayer video games – and killjoy interfacial AIs, inclusive).
- **3.** Genuine Broad-Spectrum Solutions (Panrevolution, Panadvance, Panreform and Panoverhaul inclusive).
- **4.** Inspired (as opposed to mere trial and error) research and development.
- **5.** Ghost Machines (machines constructed chiefly from deep fractal girders).
- **6.** A WOPPACCO (WOrldwide Pyramid PArliament-Court-COrporation).
- **7.** Deep fractal technology (deep fractal girder technology inclusive).
- **8.** Game development (game development tools inclusive).
- **9.** Player generated content (devtools, game levels, etc.).
- **10.** 5G through 10G mobile phone technology.
- **11.** Multitudifariously Synergetic Hi-Tech.
- **12.** Empowerment and enfranshisement.
- **13.** Collaboration (co-working inclusive).
- **14.** Core Creativity Infrastructure.
- **15.** Transformative Technology.
- **16.** Computer hardware design.
- **17.** Learning to learn (PLAY).
- **18.** Early childhood learning.
- **19.** Runescape mindscape.
- **20.** Language Engineering.
- **21.** Curriculum formulation.
- **22.** Startup and innovation.
- **23.** Artificial intelligence.
- **24.** Systems analysis.
- **25.** Cloud computing.
- **26.** Edge computing.
- **27.** Virtual reality.
- **28.** Imagineering.
- **29.** Automation.
- **30.** Inclusion.

To the point they collectively comprise a Panmovement's Panrevolution's Panadvance's Panreform's Panoverhaul's Genuine Broad-Spectrum Solution for Earth!
Ergo *Incredibly Creative* people tend to be *Incredibly Playful*!
In fact — as general rule – the *MOST Creative* folk tend to be the *MOST Playful*!
To the point where they Feel ***MAIMED*** by the current UTTER ABSENCE of technology specifically tailored to meet their *Special NEEDS*!
But WHY OH WHY would ANY business WANT to thus Cater to the *Special NEEDS* of so minuscule a market?
Thus to the *Special NEEDS* of the *MOST Creative* and consequently *MOST Playful* of folk?
Where folk *CANNOT* work that out for themselves, I am afraid that *NO-ONE* BUT *NO-ONE* can assist them therewith!

## World class problems

Needless to say, many of the difficulties the planet is currently experiencing are world class and worsening.
Here is a mere eclectic selection of them:

- **1.** The greenhouse effect.
- **2.** Climate change.
- **3.** The hole in the ozone layer / changes to the radiation of the sun and resultant ultraviolet ray damage to plants, crops, animals and humans.
(I.e. increasing levels of ultraviolet radiation sterilizing all land life within the next fifty years.)
- **4.** Widening disease pools.
- **5.** Supergerms and superweeds (our hospitals and farms are breeding grounds for).
- **6.** Herbicide, pesticide and antibiotic resistance.
- **7.** AIDS and AIDSlike diseases (not just in humans but also in animals and plants).
- **8.** Prions (or biologically independently existing replicating molecules).
- **9.** Weakening immune systems.
- **10.** Salinity.
- **11.** Ever more intense (in fact I gather we will eventually need an additional two cyclone categories) and increasing numbers of storms and cyclones.
- **12.** Ever more intense and increasing numbers of extreme weather events generally.
- **13.** Ever greater and increasing numbers of tidal waves and earthquakes.
- **14.** Ever more 1 in 20, 1 in 50 and 1 in a 100; year events generally.
- **15.** The cutting down of rainforests or the 'lungs of the Earth'.
- **16.** Pollution of the air, water, soil and genetic pool.
- **17.** Nanotechnology and genetic engineering.
- **18.** Corporate greed driven, artificial intelligence driven, automation (putting over 90% of the worldwide workforce out of work by 2050, etc.).
- **19.** 5G mobile phone technology turning our towns and cities into low power microwave ovens.
- **20.** Planned 6G through 12G mobile phone technology (skipping infrared rays, visible light and ultraviolet light and) utilizing x-rays, gamma rays, etc. to facilitate the Downloading of the consciousness of humanity (likely via their mobile phones) and eventually of life more generally, into an Expanded Internet and thus the transformation of Earth into a Living Machine Planet.
- **21.** Nuclear waste.
- **22.** Science, technology and our StartUp and Innovation Ecosystem creating *EVER* BIGGER and *EVER* MORE problems in the course of attempting to solve Earth's myriad myriad *EVER* growing, *EVER* MORE severe, *EVER* MORE multifocal, *EVER* MORE complex and *EVER* MORE mass and mainstream media (Voice of Evil) played-down, covered-up and swept-under-the-carpet woes.
- **23.** Population growth (food, clean water, shelter, etc.).
- **24.** Ever increasing crime rate.
- **25.** Ever increasing corruption.
- **26.** The biggest scum and/or incompetents ever more nearly exclusively rising to the top.
- **27.** Evidence of worldwide mental convulsion (i.e. road rage, air rage, toy rage, computer rage, rage generally; ever increasing pornography in the media and elsewhere, ever increasing – and arguably media sponsored – preoccupation with frivolous immorality, ever increasing numbers of degenerates and 'hellbents', universities no longer even pretending to offer their students the tools to think, thieves and opportunists generally more and more coming out of the woodwork in droves during disasters; ever increasing numbers of whale beachings / suicides generally; other changes in the behaviour of the animal, etc. kingdoms; etc., etc.) generally.
- **28.** Rising sea levels.
- **29.** The imminent death of the sea.
- **30.** The imminent run out of shallow (the deep stuff is useless) oil reserves.
- **31.** Increasingly erratic celestial phenomena.
- **32.** Collapsing systems generally.
- **33.** Assorted synergistic effects arising therefrom.
- **34.** Ever increasing mayhem generally.

## Transformative technology

Transformative technology SHOULD be *ALL* about Building the *future of human Possibility*.
*ALL* about *leveraging tech* for *Genuine spiritual, mental and physical; health and Well-being*.
*ALL* about *Genuine spiritual, mental and physical Transformation* generally.
*ALL* about consequent spiritual and mental Divine Happiness, Divine Merriment, Divine Joy and Divine Bliss!
Which **BEYOND *BEGS*** the following three questions:

- WHAT exactly *IS* the *Engine Room of Genuine Well-Being*?
Thus the *Powerhouse of Genuine Well-Being*?
- WHAT exactly *IS* the *Source of Genuine Well-Being*?
- WHERE exactly *IS* this *Font of Genuine Well-Being*?

I mean we KNOW *FULL FULL* WELL that ***Negative energy*** is the **ROOT CAUSE** of *ALL* spiritual, mental and physical:

- disease,
- illness,
- injury,
- accident,
- mischief,
- mischance,
- misfortune,
- misadventure,
- disaster (both personal and general),
- cataclysm (both personal and general) and
- mayhem generally!

But WHAT is the *Well-Spring of the EXACT OPPOSITE*?
Thus collectively comprises the *Holy Grail of Genuine*:

- **1.** spiritual,
- **2.** mental and
- **3.** physical;

*Health*?
Or that that can Dispel *ALL* Darkness – matter (concentrated deformed evil energy), spacetime and ***Negative energy*** inclusive?
Thus Correct both this Epicentre of Evil Universe and Cancerous Quarantined Sector of Creation?


- Why *THAT* without which NOTHING ELSE can **BEGIN TO *BEGIN*** to exist!
Or the *LIGHT and LOVE of Highest Heaven*!!
Thus the Highest Wavelength's Font of Creation's formless timeless Grey Energy's Blizzard of Crystalline Perfection!
- Which *Stitch* in *Time*.
*Once of Prevention* preventing a *TON of CURE*!
Oft *DIRE DIRE **DISEASE*** Required *DRASTIC DRASTIC **MEASURE***!!

## Envirosocioeconomic Advance

Recently on hearing of the official launch of YET another startup and innovation hub, I had a quick squiz at their website and my first thoughts not unexpectedly were:

Does said Precinct offer:

- co-working space for emerging entrepreneurs and startups.
- secure, leasable offices starting from 41m&#x00B2;
- unique event spaces including the 150 pax Stair Stadium and 100 pax Seminar Room.
- ample meeting spaces.
- startup accelerator and incubator programs offered by foundation tenants, River City Labs.
- regular networking and business upskilling events hosted by the Office of the Queensland Chief Entrepreneur.
- a Regional Landing Pad providing complimentary, short-term 'soft landing' space for regional and international entrepreneurs.
- a dedicated Precinct community manager, workplace manager and concierge desk.
- modern common areas, including kitchen and end of trip facilities.

Why yes it does!
(NO surprises there.)

Is it part of the Queensland Government's $755 million Advance Queensland initiative?

Why yes it is.
(Again NO surprises there.)

Does it offer the ***world's first startup and innovation hub in the form of a multiplayer video game***?

Why *NO* it DOES *NOT*!!
(Again NO surprises there.)

Such I consequently and perfectly understandably sent them the following email:

> The world's first startup and innovation hub in the form of a multiplayer video game.
>
> I gather there are currently *tens of thousands of startup and innovation hubs worldwide* – but ZERO *startup and innovation hubs* in the form of a *multiplayer video game*.
>
> *Incredibly creative* people tend to be *incredibly playful*.
>
> In fact the *most creative* of people tend to be *far and away the most playful*.
>
> Further the simplest, easiest, quickest, most natural, most intrinsically innate, most imaginative, most insightful, most in-depth, most inclusive, most sound and sensible, most meaningful, most Creative, most foolproof, most forward thinking, most futuristic, most *fun* Fun *FUN*, most visionary, most kind, caring and Loving and generally BEST way; for almost anything (AI inclusive) or anyone to learn, teach, coach, master and utilize almost anything is through interactive *PLAY*!
>
> Further play is *learning to learn*!
>
> Hence one HAS to wonder *WHY* **Queensland Innovation Hub** does NOT offer a *multiplayer video game variant* of itself.
>
> I mean this is the *twenty-first century* for crying out loud!
> *NOT* the Dark Ages, Stone Age, point at which life first crawled up out of the sea or Hadean Eon!
>
> Moreover as a *very great many folk* have unendingly pointed out of late:
>
> > **Our planet is BURNING _DOWN_!!**
>
> Hence it is time to offer *modern*, *farsighted*, *inspired*, *revolutionary* and *visionary* tools and methodologies!
>
> Thus *tools and methodologies* better suited to the *times we live in*.
>
> Tools and methodologies that will best *advance* society, the economy and the environment.
>
> VERY preferably *BEFORE* there is NO LONGER a society, economy or environment to *advance*!

Ergo one *CANNOT* Advance by *walking backward*!
*CANNOT* Advance anything by *being backward*!
I mean it is ONLY *common sense* that that would be so!

## Employ Everyone

Of my very great many (they all Intermesh into a Complex Whole — thus into a Genuine Broad-Spectrum Solution for Earth) Business Ideas, I feel my 'Employ Everyone' Business Idea best comes under the term 'Trans Tech'.
As it will relieve the MAXIMUM amount of:

- **1.** suffering,
- **2.** torment,
- **3.** torture,
- **4.** trauma,
- **5.** misery,
- **6.** horror,
- **7.** pain and
- **8.** death;

worldwide.

Whilst likewise MAXIMALLY:

- providing a **_going to play_ as opposed to mere _school or work_** style, ***TONS* of FUN and a Future** style, human player and AI player played in mindscape style, VAST intermeshing *multiplayer video game library* based, work environment for,
- decreasing the likelihood of **90% to 99% unemployment by 2050** due to corporate greed *DRIVEN*, AI *Driven* automation for,
- thus replacing corporate GREED DRIVEN, AI Driven automation with a **_VERY_ PEOPLE _HUNGRY_ Man/AI Synergy** for,
- thus providing ***MEANINGFUL*** Grand Adventures and Mighty Quests for,
- generally employing, empowering and enfranchising,
- generally increasing job satisfaction for;
- generally increasing the spiritual Well-Being of,
- generally increasing the mental Well-Being of and
- generally increasing the physical Well-Being of;

billions of folk worldwide.

Ergo 'Employ Everyone' will operate via an EVER expanding Internet of Play.
Thus as a:

- **1.** binary to advanced navigated,
- **2.** very gentle to very steep learning curve proffering,
- **3.** **_going to play_ as opposed to mere _school or work_** style,
- **4.** *TONS* of FUN and a Future style,
- **5.** One-Stop-Shop of one-stop-shops style,
- **6.** rapidly (the mass and mainstream media are LYING through their TEETH) **BURNING DOWN** planet ***DRIVEN***,
- **7.** corporate GREED, Trans Tech, innovation and startup ecosystem, R&D ecosystem and free software movement; envirosocioeconomically **DRIVEN**,
- **8.** thus purely pragmatic and practical, concrete concern ***Driven***,
- **9.** Lingual Labmaker, Language Forge, Lingual Lab, Language Machine Shop, Lingual Labbench and Language Workbench **Driven**,
- **10.** Core Creativity Infrastructure ***driven***,
- **11.** Thus ***MEANINGFUL*** Grand Adventure and Mighty Quest **driven**,
- **12.** curriculum formulation ecosystem *DRIVEN*,
- **13.** twin-thoughtstationed (thoughtrains are bigger on the inside than on the outside) thoughtrain comprised, game level comprised, cybergod (AI player) comprised, pantheon of cybergods comprised, AI Hive comprised, AI player and human player played in mindscape comprised, multiplayer video game comprised, VAST library of multiplayer games DRIVEN; AI and human twin-curriculum DRIVEN, Overcyberbrain DRIVEN,
- **14.** twin-thoughtstationed thoughtrain comprised, game level comprised, cybergod comprised, pantheon of cybergods comprised, AI Hive comprised, AI player and human player played in mindscape comprised, multiplayer video game comprised, VAST library of multiplayer games *Driven*; AI and human twin-curriculum *Driven*, Highercyberbrain *Driven*,
- **15.** Cybermidbrain (Killjoy AI Interface) failsafed, safeguarded and Driven,
- **16.** Cyberlowerbrain (Cloud) *driven*,
- **17.** Cyberbrainstem (Edge) driven,
- **18.** Internet of AIs, Internet of Servers, Internet of People and Internet of Things.

With the Internet of Play to slowly but surely percolate and penetrate Downward into the:

- Cybermidbrain (Killjoy AI Interface) failsafed, safeguarded and Driven,
- Cyberlowerbrain (Cloud),
- Cyberbrainstem (Edge) and
- Internet of AIs, Internet of Servers, Internet of People and Internet of Things;

due to the:

- *FAR FAR* GREATER quality and quantity of software,
- *FAR FAR* GREATER quality and quantity of hardware,
- *FAR FAR* GREATER efficiencies generally and
- consequent *FAR FAR* GREATER commercial returns;

that the Internet of Play will thus Permit in which areas.
That is — just as with self-driving cars — there will be myriad safety concerns that will NEED to be addressed.
Or at least that is the current Plan regards which Key Facet of my Broad-Spectrum Solution for Earth.


## Grand Army of Enchanted Toys

The main *twenty two elements* thereof to comprise:

- **1.** thoughtstationed (thus larger on the inside than on the outside) thoughtrain comprised, game level comprised, AI player comprised, cybergod comprised, pantheon of cybergods comprised, Hive AI comprised, mindscape comprised, multiplayer game comprised, VAST library of video games *DRIVEN*; Cloud DRIVEN, Edge *Driven*, Internet of Things Driven, 5G mobile phone technology *driven*; thoughtstationed thoughtrain comprised, game level comprised, AI player comprised, cybertoy mind driven; cybertoys (screen-faced toys inclusive),
- **2.** infinitely fractally deep (micro-universe – atoms are micro-universes – to umpteenth-micro-universe) holographic computing DRIVEN; Infinity Toys (micro-universal-toys to umpteenth-micro-universal-toys),
- **3.** Mindscape (chakra – or centre of consciousness – etc.) Correcting Toys,
- **4.** almost exclusively ghostgirder (very deep fractal girder) comprised ghostoys,
- **5.** 3D Printed Toys (3D printing toys inclusive),
- **6.** Loved-To-Death Teddy Bears,
- **7.** Transformative Tech toys,
- **8.** VR (Virtual Reality) toys,
- **9.** Toymaker Pied Pipers,
- **10.** Toymaking Tools,
- **11.** holographic toys,
- **12.** compound toys,
- **13.** musical toys,
- **14.** priontoys,
- **15.** microtoys,
- **16.** nanotoys,
- **17.** picotoys,
- **18.** femotoys,
- **19.** attotoys,
- **20.** zeptotoys,
- **21.** yoctotoys and
- **22.** toys that are a combination thereof;

thus which Key Facet of Contingency Plan A's Downpouring of Light's Genuine Broad-Spectrum Solution for Earth's Envirosocioeconomic Panmovement's Panrevolution's Panadvance's Panreform Panoverhaul!

Ergo Earth's sum AIs **URGENTLY URGENTLY *NEED*** to:

- PLAY (thus learn to learn) with,
- take part in a **_going to play_ as opposed to mere _work or school_ concept** with and
- generally interact with **billions of children** worldwide – thus as part of a **_VERY_ PEOPLE _HUNGRY_ man-machine Symbiosis**;

if both the _quality_ and _quantity_ of Earth's:

- sum research and development's Advance,
- sum startup and innovation ecosystem's Advance,
- sum Transformative Technology's Advance,
- sum Core Creativity Infrastructure's Advance,
- sum curriculum formulation's Advance,
- sum AI software, AI hardware and AI *driven* automation's Advance and
- hence SUM envirosocioeconomic Advance generally;

is to be ***MAXIMALLY***:

- very deep fractally,
- kaleidoscopically,
- synergistically,
- multifariously,
- exponentially,
- eclectically and
- otherwise;

Socially Responsibly ***Accelerated***.

## Voice of Evil

The mass and mainstream media's *greatest skill* is taking the Truth and Standing It right on its Head!
Hence it:

- **1.** tries to make out that *out-and-out-devils* are somehow *absolute angels*,
- **2.** tries to make out that the *most upright of folk* are somehow *bad and mad, out and out devils*,
- **3.** quite regularly multiplies accurate statistics by one hundred and
- **4.** quite regularly divides accurate statistics by one hundred.

The mass and mainstream media is attempting to *EVER* MORE:

- **1.** tone-down,
- **2.** play-down,
- **3.** cover-up and
- **4.** sweep-under-the-carpet;

the Truth.

Ergo the mass and mainstream media is well well aware that the:

- **1.** *BIGGER*,
- **2.** Warmer,
- **3.** Fuzzier and
- **4.** MORE Comfortable the *LIE*;

the *MORE* likely folk are to believe it!
That most folk thus and otherwise see *white as black* and *black as white*!

The mass and mainstream media also acts to both:

- encourage a *frivolous preoccupation with evil* and
- *Feed* EVER *MORE* negativity into the System more generally.

## TT1 subset, TaleTome Lingual Lab and TaleTome Genesis computer language

I am currently planning to formulate TT1 subset, TaleTome Lingual Lab and TaleTome genesis computer language in the form of a storybook style:

- breathtakingly user-friendly and AI friendly,
- variable (very gentle to very steep) learning curved,
- empowering, enfranchising and inclusive,
- exhaustively in-game tutorialed,
- devtooltrain punctuated (development-tool-train), devtoolscape (development-tool-thoughtrain-scape) studded and storyquest libraried,
- binary (you click on either the left or right page) to advance navigated and optional read-aloud functionalitied,
- assorted variable comprised,
- word-bubble, stick-figure-sprite and orchestration comprised,
- page (screenshot half) comprised,
- screenshot (page pair) comprised,
- thoughtstationed thoughtrain (ergo thoughtrains will be larger on the inside that on the outside and have a thoughtstation in both the trainengine and caboose) comprised,
- game level comprised,
- AI player (cybergod) comprised,
- pantheon of cybergods comprised,
- Hive AI comprised,
- AI and human player played in mindscape comprised,
- TONS of *FUN* and a Future style and
- supremely simple, surface game levelled and extremely complex, deep game levelled;

multiplayer video game!

## Television Series

Perhaps a half dozen *reality television series* or:

- **1.** Enchanted Army (for younger children),
- **2.** Infinity Toys (for older children),
- **3.** Timestormtroopers (for tweens),
- **4.** Runescape Mindscape (for teens),
- **5.** Employ Everyone (for adults) and
- **6.** 2100 *NOW*!!! (for adults);

or some such based upon the above Concept would be an Excellent Idea.
